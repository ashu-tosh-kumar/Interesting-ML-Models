# Interesting-ML-Models
This repository contains interesting Machine Learning models that explain some interesting fact.
Model added:

1) Ruleof72: The rule of 72 states that "To estimate the length of time an amount of money takes to double, simply divide its assumed annual growth rate into 72 i.e. at 6% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR), your principal money would get doubled in 72/6 = 12 years". We aim to derive the constant 72 in this Machine Learning model.
